🕹️ ROM Inspector v0.1.0 Beta
ROM Inspector is a shell script designed for the TrimUI Brick running NextUI, enabling you to efficiently manage and analyze your ROM collections and artwork.
This initial beta release provides a set of tools to optimize your SD card file organization by identifying and resolving common issues with ROMs and covers.

✨ Key Features :
✅ ROM Size Verification
Identifies ROMs with suspicious sizes (too small or too large) based on system-specific thresholds, with an option to delete after confirmation.

♻️ Duplicate ROM Removal
Detects and allows you to remove duplicate ROMs per system to save space.

📄 Missing Covers List
Scans for ROMs without corresponding cover images and generates a detailed report.

🗑️ Orphaned Files Detection
Finds cover images without matching ROMs, with an option to delete.

🖼️ Cover Resolution Check
Identifies covers with incorrect resolutions (e.g., not 480x480 or too low), with an option to delete.

📊 Detailed Statistics
Generates reports on ROM counts per system, cover usage percentage, and disk usage (ROMs and covers).

⚙️ Technical Details
Compatibility: Optimized for TrimUI Brick with NextUI, supports .media folders.

Interface: Uses minui-list for intuitive menu navigation.

Logs: Detailed logs saved in :
/mnt/SDCARD/.userdata/tg5040/logs/Rom Inspector.txt for debugging and tracking.

Exported Reports: Generates text files (e.g., missing_covers.txt, rom_sizes_report.txt) saved in :
/mnt/SDCARD/ for offline analysis.

Safety: User confirmation required before deleting any files.

Performance: Limits processing to 1000 files per system to prevent overload.
